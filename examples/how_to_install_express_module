To add a handler, take login as example:
1 create login.js. In this js, must declare interface "exports.onRequest = function(req, res){}".
2 put the handler to express's map, in server.js, add such line "app.post("/login", require("./login").onRequest)". app.post means it's a post request.
"/login" is the path. "onRequest" is the interface in login.js.
3 to send response to client, use server.respond(res, code, body). res is the res passed to your onRequest function. code is the http code. body is the http body.
